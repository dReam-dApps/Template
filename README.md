# Template
Template for building [Dero](https://dero.io) and [dReam dApps](https://dreamdapps.io)

![dReamer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SixofClubsss/dreamdappsite/main/assets/dReamerUp.png)

This app serves no purpose other then to help you build on Dero. It uses [Fyne](https://fyne.io/) and [dReams packages](https://github.com/dReam-dApps/dReams) to make a  GUI shell app pre-configured with Dero RPC connection and [Gnomon](https://github.com/civilware/Gnomon) indexer. 

The repo is structured in a way so you can build isolated dApps, as well as ones that can be integrated with other Dero dApps. As the dReams platform evolves this Template will evolve with it. The code comments will currently serve as the main guide on how to build with this Template and integrate into dReams.
